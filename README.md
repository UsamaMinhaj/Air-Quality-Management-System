# Air-Quality-Management-System

The project measured the Air Quality index of its environment along with humidity and temperature using sensors. The data was sent to the user on his mobile app using NodeMCU built-in WiFi-Module. This data was also sent to Desktop using ThingSpeak and further processed by using embedded MATLAB if any additional computation was required. 

A screenshot of the data from different sensors coming to ThingSpeak is given below:
